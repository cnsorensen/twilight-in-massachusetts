# Twilight in Massachusetts - A Christine Sorney Mystery
*Note: Game is not completed yet*

This is definitely *not* a spite game against a Female Software company 
and their recent lack of producing mystery games starring a Fancy detective.

## Description
18-year-old Christine Sorney drops out of high school and travels to Salem, 
Massachusetts leaving her hometown of River Depths behind. But when her 
roommate goes missing, Christine tries to find out what happened and gets 
wrapped in a neo-witch cult.
